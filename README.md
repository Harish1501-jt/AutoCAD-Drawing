Hello! I'm a passionate Mechanical Engineer with a strong interest in CAD drawing, 3D modeling, and 3D printing. My background in mechanical design fuels my enthusiasm for creating precise and innovative engineering solutions. Over the years, I've developed expertise in working with AutoCAD and other industry-standard CAD software, allowing me to bring ideas from concept to reality through detailed technical drawings and immersive 3D models.

I enjoy sharing my work and collaborating with others in the engineering and maker community. Whether it's designing functional prototypes, optimizing mechanical systems, or exploring the possibilities of additive manufacturing (3D printing), I strive to stay at the cutting edge of technology and creativity.

What You’ll Find in This Repository
This repository features a curated collection of my AutoCAD drawings, including mechanical components, assemblies, and design concepts. The aim is to provide useful references, inspiration, and learning resources for students, engineers, and makers interested in mechanical design and CAD modeling.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to these designs. If you have any questions, feedback, or collaboration ideas, I'm always open to connecting with fellow enthusiasts

Thank you for visiting my repository. Let’s innovate together!
